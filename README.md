# create-python-module README

Duplicates the useful functionality in PyCharm whereby you can create a directory
and populate it with an `__init__.py` file with one command.

## Usage

Simply right click on a folder in the File Explorer, enter a name, and a folder
will be created there containing an empty `__init__.py` file.

## TODO

This is a very basic extension, simply to give me a start on creating
extensions for VSCode while filling a serious lack I find in VSCode. It is
missing :

- Tests
- Error Checking
- Proper README
- Add the proper file path 'slash' depending on OS.

## Requirements

Just VSCode.

## Extension Settings

None.

## Known Issues

None known (yet)

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial Internal testing Release
